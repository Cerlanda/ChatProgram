In order to have the program working, a few changes are necessary. Here is a small guide, which describes step-by-step on what needs to be done:

1: Open the Server folder.
2: Open the Project1.sln file.
3: Find #define section.
4: Click on your internet connections, click your connected network and click "Properties"
5: Scroll down and find your IP-address and port.
6: Go back to the Project1.sln file.
7: Edit #define IP_ADDRESS to your IP: Remember the quotation marks.
8: Edit #define DEFAULT_PORT to your port: Remember the quotation marks. 
Now the server is good to go. Let's continue with the client.
9: Open the Client folder.
10: Open the Project2.sln file.
11: Edit #define IP_ADDRESS to your ip: Remember quotation marks.
12: Edit #define DEFAULT_PORT to your port: Remeber quotation marks.
Note: It is very important that the server and client have the same IP-address and Port, otherwise the program will not run.

You are now good to go. You can open multiple clients as well.
