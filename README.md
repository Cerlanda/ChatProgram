In order to have the program working, a few changes are necessary. Here is a small guide, which describes step-by-step on what needs to be done:<br><br>

1: Open the Server folder.<br>
2: Open the Project1.sln file.<br>
3: Find #define section.<br>
4: Click on your internet connections, click your connected network and click "Properties"<br>
5: Scroll down and find your IP-address and port.<br>
6: Go back to the Project1.sln file.<br>
7: Edit #define IP_ADDRESS to your IP: Remember the quotation marks.<br>
8: Edit #define DEFAULT_PORT to your port: Remember the quotation marks. <br>
Now the server is good to go. Let's continue with the client.<br>
9: Open the Client folder.<br>
10: Open the Project2.sln file.<br>
11: Edit #define IP_ADDRESS to your ip: Remember quotation marks.<br>
12: Edit #define DEFAULT_PORT to your port: Remeber quotation marks.<br>
Note: It is <b>very</b> important that the server and client have the same IP-address and Port, otherwise the program will not run.<br><br>

You are now good to go. You can open multiple clients as well.
